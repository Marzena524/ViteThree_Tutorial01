> how to add typescript code, which uses three.js in Vite project
- need to remove React code 
the clicker code is in App.tsx
the code starts running in main.tsx
probably because of that 
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>



add main.ts
change index.html to use "/src/main.ts"

needed to do 
npm i --save-dev @types/three 
to get the import * as THREE from 'three';
to work 



js file that worked: 
// import './style.css'
// import * as THREE from 'three';

// // Initialize Three.js
// const scene = new THREE.Scene();
// const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
// camera.position.set(2, 2, 4);
// camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
// const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

// renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
// document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// // Render the scene
// renderer.render(scene, camera);

> got the same stuff working with typescript
> pushed changes to github using vs code interface
> try to delete a file
worked!
> try to build it...
